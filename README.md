# RythmiC

RythmiC is a Vite-React project that allows you to list and play six songs. The app has a playlist feature, where you can add songs to the playlist and play them one after another automatically. The project is built using Vite, React, and React Router.

## Installation

To run the app, clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies using npm

## Usage

npm run dev

This will start the app on http://localhost:5173 by default. From the home page, you can navigate to the playlist page to view the current playlist and add songs to it. Each song card in the list has an "Add to Playlist" button that you can use to add the song to the playlist.

Once you have added songs to the playlist, you can start playing them by clicking on the "Play" button on the playlist page. The app will automatically switch to the next song in the playlist after every 8 seconds. You can pause the playlist by clicking on the "Pause" button, and resume it by clicking on the "Play" button again.

Note: If you are in the playlist page and want to switch to a different playlist, you should navigate back to the home page first, and then select the playlist from the navigation bar.

## Deployed App

The deployed version of the app can be found at https://rhythmic.netlify.app/.

## Future Improvements

- Fix the bug that requires users to navigate back to the home page before switching to a different playlist.
- Add search functionality to allow users to search for specific songs and add them to the playlist.
- Allow users to create their own playlists.
